### **Briefly about me:**

Since childhood, I dreamed of being a programmer, studied in a class with a computer science bias and entered the institute as a programmer, but due to an unfortunate set of circumstances, I became a food processing engineer and within a few years advanced to the position of director, and even managed to become a successful businessman. During my working career, I returned to my childhood dream several times, taught VBA and created macros in Excel, taught HTML, CSS, JavaScript and created web pages and uploaded them to servers, taught ReactJS, Redux, NodeJS and created applications, but this everything was at the hobby level and for my own needs. I even managed to work in one real project to create a hotel service application (ReactJS, Redux, Node.js).

But every time when there were hard times at work that required me to be very dedicated, I gave up my hobby and immersed myself in solving problems at work, but I never gave up my dream of becoming a programmer. And now the moment has come when I can immerse myself in turning my dream into reality at 100%. I retired from the position of director and devote 100% of my time to programming.
